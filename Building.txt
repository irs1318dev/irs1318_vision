Before you can build, you must first set an environment variable based on your OpenCV jar file location:
Named OPENCV_JAR which is the absolute path to the opencv_410.jar file.

For me, this is:
Windows:	/C:/opencv/build/java/opencv-410.jar
RPI:		/usr/local/share/OpenCV/java/opencv-410.jar

On Windows you can set the environment variable using Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables.
On Linux, run "export OPENCV_JAR=..." for temporary variables, or add that same text to any .sh file under /etc/profiles.d/.  Requires system reboot.

Once I have built the jar on the local machine, I can run it by running the following:
Windows:	java -jar -Djava.library.path=C:\devfrc\opencv-3.1\opencv\build\java\x64\ bin\irs1318_vision.jar
RPI:		java -jar bin/irs1318_vision.jar

Once it can run on the RPI, you can set it up to run as a service.  To do so:
1. Copy irs1318vision.service to /etc/systemd/system/irs1318vision.service
2. Run: sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
3. Run: sudo systemctl start irs1318vision.service
4. Run: sudo systemctl enable irs1318vision.service

You can run the following to check a service's status:						sudo systemctl status irs1318vision.service
You can run the following to read a service's output to stdout and stderr:	sudo journalctl -u irs1318vision
