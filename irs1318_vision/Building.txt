Before you can use the Ant build, you must first set a pair of environment variables based on your OpenCV and Pi4J jar file locations:
1. Named OPENCV_JAR which is the absolute path to the opencv_310.jar file.
2. Named PI4J_JAR which is the absolute path to the pi4j-core.jar file.

For me, this is:
Windows:	/C:/devfrc/opencv-3.1/opencv/build/java/opencv-310.jar  and  /C:/devfrc/pi4j-1.1/pi4j-core.jar
RPI:		/usr/local/share/OpenCV/java/opencv-310.jar  and  /opt/pi4j/lib/pi4j-core.jar

On Windows you can set the environment variable using Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables.
On Linux, run "export OPENCV_JAR=..." for temporary variables, or add that same text to any .sh file under /etc/profiles.d/.  Requires system reboot.

I can then build the files using ant.  To do so:
Windows+Eclipse:	Right-click build.xml, Run as->Ant build..., select build and Create Jar, run.
RPI:				Run 'ant clean', then 'ant', then 'ant "Create Jar"' from the directory where build.xml is located.

Once I have built the jar on the local machine, I can run it by running the following:
Windows:	java -jar -Djava.library.path=C:\devfrc\opencv-3.1\opencv\build\java\x64\ bin\irs1318_vision.jar
RPI:		java -jar bin/irs1318_vision.jar
